<strong>RMH Skull Coins 001.</strong><br>
<br>
Star / shuriken-shaped coins with skull in the centre, with glowing eyes (emission channel used); possibly currency for a post-apocalyptic world, a weapon, or just a trinket for some game character. The asset comes with a mesh collider (it setup with a rigidbody object as a prefab). (presentation floor blocks are included with 2K textures)<br><br>

As always, for a better impression of the asset inside the Unity engine, please view the YouTube videos in the screenshots section.<br><br>

** prefabs are included<br>
** metallic PBR workflow used<br>
** all models are .FBX format<br>
** all screenshots are captured from inside the Unity engine<br><br>

<strong>Important Note: </strong>This asset uses Linear Color Space. To set this up in your scene, in Unity go to <strong>Edit >> Project Settings >> Player </strong>, then in the <strong>Other Settings</strong> section of the Inspector in the <strong>Color Space*</strong> drop-down menu, select <strong>Linear</strong>. Using other Color Space settings tends to make colours look washed-out / flat.
